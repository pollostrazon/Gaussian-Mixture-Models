# Gaussian Mixture Models analysis & application
This little project (in italian) gives a little introduction to GMMs and then presents an application of the technique on a little dataset which goes by the name "Seeds".

## Table of Content
- [Latex](#tex)
- [Jupyter Lab Notebook](#jupyter)
- [References](#references)

## Tex
Under `tex` subdirectory you will find .tex file, partially generated via Jupyter Lab, and the related final .pdf file.

In these documents, Gaussian Mixture Models are introduced without going too deep, but giving a proper background and explaining why we headed to this kind of technique starting from K-means. The second chapter of the pdf is just an export of the Jupyter notebook.

## Jupyter
Under `jupyter` subdirectory you will find "Seeds" dataset in tsv format and requirements for the project to work in a Python virtual environment together with, of course, the Jupyter Lab notebook.

GMMs are applied to the dataset and a qualitative analysis is performed on the results.
